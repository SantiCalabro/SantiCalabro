### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Santiago. I'm from Argentina
I'm a passionate web developer, graphic designer, tattoo artist and a huge fan of music. Welcome to my Github!

 ðŸ¤“ The projects you're about to see have involved these technologies so far: 
* Javascript
* CSS 
* HTML
* React 
* Redux
* Node JS 
* SQL
* Laravel + PHP
* Express
* Gatsby

:rocket: What I love the most about development is the possibility of bringing solutions to real life problems and transforming it, so I'm planning to add Kotlin and Swift to that list in a short future, and expand my horizons to Mobile Developement. 

I hope you enjoy checking out my work. Feel free to <a
