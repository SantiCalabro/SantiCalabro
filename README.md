### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Santiago and I'm from Argentina. I am a Fullstack Web Developer, and quite a passionate troubleshoot errors solver ðŸ˜‚ 
ðŸŽ“ I'm also a graphic designer, so that explains my strong vocation as a Front End developer. But the truth is that the more I learn and dig into backend and APIs, the more I love them! Welcome to my Github!

 ðŸ¤“ The projects you're about to see have involved these technologies so far: 
* Javascript
* CSS 
* HTML
* React 
* Redux
* Node JS 
* SQL
* Laravel + PHP
* Express
* Gatsby

I hope you enjoy checking out my work. Feel free to <a
